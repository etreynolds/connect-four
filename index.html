    <h1>Let's Play Connect Four!</h1>
    <p>Connect Four is a game for two players. The players alternate turns, dropping a piece of their color in the top
        of a column. The piece will fall down to the further-down unoccupied slot. The game is won when a player makes
        four in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The game is a tie if the entire board fills up without
        a winner.</p>
